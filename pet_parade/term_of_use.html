        <p>In-Game Currencies and Goods</p>

        (&laquo;Virtual Currency&raquo;), such as coins, cash, and/or cards, that
        can be purchased for real money and in turn used to purchase virtual

        does not handle and is not responsible for handling transactions acquiring
        Virtual Currency. All Virtual Currency transactions are handled by
        third-party e-commerce payment providers. By purchasing in-game Virtual
        Currency, you are bound by and agree to the third-party payment
        providers&rsquo; Terms of Use.
      </p>

        value. Transferring Virtual Currency or Virtual Items outside the Games is
        strictly prohibited, meaning that you may not buy or sell Virtual Currency
        or Virtual Items for real money or otherwise exchange Virtual Currency or
        Virtual Items for items of value outside the Games.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        You also agree that all prices and sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual
        Items are final. Neither third-party payment providers nor Company issue
        refunds for completed transactions except as provided in this Terms of
        Use. Please note that you only purchase a limited, revocable,
        non-transferable license to use in-game Virtual Currency or Virtual Items,
        and you agree that you do not own them. In the event your account is
        limited, terminated, suspended, modified, or deleted for any reason, at
        Company&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion, or if Company discontinues
        its Games, you forfeit any and all Virtual Currency and Virtual Items
        earned or purchased. Company has the absolute right to manage, regulate,
        control, modify, and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Items as
        it sees fit and at its sole discretion, and Company is under no obligation
        to compensate you or anyone else for any resulting losses.
